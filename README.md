## Number Classifier

# Purpose:
It helps to check whether the number is positive or negative and whether its odd or even.

# How it works:
-It checks for 2 conditions each time: if it is divisble by 2 or not, and if it is bigger than 0 or not.
-It prints the result then, but if it is 0 it will print it is zero and even cause zero isnt positive or negative.
